# Competency - Language JavaScript Node.js<br />Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment for executing JavaScript code server-side. Historically, JavaScript was used primarily for client-side scripting, in which scripts written in JavaScript are embedded in a webpage's HTML, to be run client-side by a JavaScript engine in the user's web browser. Node.js enables JavaScript to be used for server-side scripting, and runs scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js has become one of the foundational elements of the "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[5] allowing web application development to unify around a single programming language, rather than rely on a different language for writing server side scripts.<br />Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js<br />Home: https://nodejs.org <br />How do you prove it?<br />For code you have submitted, your code reviews get little syntactic corrections.<br />You can write code from memory without having to look up how you use language specific features.<br />You can explain to someone the differences between this language and another language.<br />You can describe the kinds of problem the language solves very well and the problems it?s not a great fit for.<br />You understand packaging paradigms for the language.<br />You have a good understanding of the resources and where to go if you?re stuck.<br />You understand how third party libraries are used, access, their lifecycle and security implications.<br />How do you improve it?<br />Read: JavaScript the Good Parts https://7chan.org/pr/src/OReilly_JavaScript_The_Good_Parts_May_2008.pdf <br /><br />Read the docs: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/ <br />Memorize the cheat sheet: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeCoupa/awesome-cheatsheets/master/backend/node.js <br />Understand package management: https://www.npmjs.com/ https://npmcompare.com/ <br />Build some software.<br />What this video from Soundcloud on how to use functional programming to reduce code boilerplate. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA4-b7hvWhg<br /><br />
