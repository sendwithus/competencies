# Competency - User Audits

All of our systems need to be audited regularly to make sure that only the correct users exist, and those users that exist have the correct access.

## How do you prove it?

Audit spot checks reveal no users that should not exist in systems you manage.

Audit spot checks reveal no users with incorrect permissions in those systems.

Elevated permissions for a user have an electronic audit trail to validate when they were given access, why they needed this access, and when the access will be revoked / reduced.

## How do you improve it?

Audit your systems on a regular basis.

Keep track of who has what permissions and why.
