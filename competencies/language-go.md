# Competency - Language Go

Go (often referred to as golang for googling purposes) is a programming language created at Google in 2009 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is a compiled, statically typed language in the tradition of Algol and C, with garbage collection, limited structural typing, memory safety features and CSP-style concurrent programming features added. The compiler and other language tools originally developed by Google are all free and open source.

## How do you prove it?

For code you have submitted, your code reviews get few syntactic corrections.

You can write code from memory without having to look up how you use language specific features.

You can explain to someone the differences, advantages and disadvantages of this language in comparison to others.

You can describe the kinds of problem the language solves very well and the problems it's not a great fit for.

You understand packaging paradigms for the language.

You have a good understanding of the resources and where to go if you're stuck.

You understand how third party libraries are used, access, their lifecycle and security implications.

You understand the testing frameworks of this language, and have the ability to describe the idiomatic ways of doing tasks with the language.
