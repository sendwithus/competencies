# Competency - Language Go Level 1
[Go](https://golang.org/) (often referred to as golang for googling purposes) is a programming language created at Google in 2009 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is a compiled, statically typed language in the tradition of Algol and C, with garbage collection, limited structural typing, memory safety features and CSP-style concurrent programming features added. The compiler and other language tools originally developed by Google are all free and open source. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language))
