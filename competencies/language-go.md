# Competency - Language Go Level 1
[Go](https://golang.org/) (often referred to as golang for googling purposes) is a programming language created at Google in 2009 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is a compiled, statically typed language in the tradition of Algol and C, with garbage collection, limited structural typing, memory safety features and CSP-style concurrent programming features added. The compiler and other language tools originally developed by Google are all free and open source. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language))

## How do you prove it?
* You can explain to someone the differences between this language and another language.
* You have a good understanding of the resources and where to go if you're stuck.
* You understand how third party libraries are used, accessed, and installed.
* You have written and completed a demo-able project in this language.

## How do you improve it?
* Do the [tour](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1)
* Read the [docs](https://golang.org/doc/)
* Read [Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
* Build some software
* Learn [best practices](https://blog.chewxy.com/2018/03/18/golang-interfaces/)
* Learn about building [memory performant golang](https://segment.com/blog/allocation-efficiency-in-high-performance-go-services/)

# Competency - Language Go Level 2

## How do you prove it?
* For code you have submitted, your code reviews receive few syntactic corrections.
* You can write code from memory without having to look up how you use language specific features.
* You can describe the kinds of problems the language solves very well and the kinds of problems it's not a great fit for.
* You understand packaging paradigms for the language for both publishing and dependency management.
* You understand how to review third party libraries lifecycles and security implications.
* You can create [reproducible build](https://reproducible-builds.org/) by trimming paths and setting static build id in built binary.

## How do you improve it?
* Open many PRs
* Memorize the [cheat sheet](https://github.com/a8m/go-lang-cheat-sheet/blob/master/golang_refcard.pdf)
* Understand [package management](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules)
* Attend [Gophercon](https://www.gophercon.com/)
* Online [json to struct converter](https://mholt.github.io/json-to-go/)
* Learn about and do some [fuzzing](https://dgryski.medium.com/go-fuzz-github-com-arolek-ase-3c74d5a3150c)
