# Competency - ML Framework - TensorFlow

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications. TensorFlow was developed by the Google Brain team for internal Google use. It was released under the Apache License 2.0 on November 9, 2015. Google created TensorFlow to replace Theano. The two libraries are in fact quite similar. Some of the creators of Theano, such as Ian Goodfellow, went on to create TensorFlow at Google before leaving for OpenAI.
