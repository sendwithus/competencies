# Competency - Natural Language Processing

Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.
Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural language generation.

A few examples of NLP that still are hot topics in research are:

- Spell check
- Autocomplete
- Voice text messaging
- Spam filters
- Related keywords on search engines
- Voice detection and translation, such as Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant

In any case, the computer is able to identify the appropriate word, phrase, or response by using context clues, the same way that any human would. Conceptually, it’s a fairly straightforward technology.
Where NLP outperforms humans is in the amount of language and data it’s able to process. Therefore, its potential uses go beyond the examples above and make possible tasks that would’ve otherwise taken employees months or years to accomplish.
