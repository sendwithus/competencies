# Competency - Language TypeScript Level 1
TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to the language. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript)

## How do you prove it?
* You can explain to someone the differences between this language and another language.
* You have a good understanding of the resources and where to go if you're stuck.
* You understand how third party libraries are used, accessed, and installed.
* You have written and completed a demo-able project in this language.

## How do you improve it?
Read the TypeScript documentation directly [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html).

## Key points of research
* Differences between TypeScript & JavaScript
* Interfaces
* async/await
* Decorators
* Extends and Implements
* Use Generics
* Unions && Discriminated Unions

# Competency - Language TypeScript Level 2

## How do you prove it?
* For code you have submitted, your code reviews receive few syntactic corrections.
* You can write code from memory without having to look up how you use language specific features.
* You can describe the kinds of problems the language solves very well and the kinds of problems it's not a great fit for.
* You understand packaging paradigms for the language for both publishing and dependency management.
* You understand how to review third party libraries lifecycles and security implications.
* You use `??` over `||` ?
* You use `object?.object?.property` instead of `object && object.object && object.object.property`

## How do you improve it?
* Open many PRs
* Learn about [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* Learn about [Declaration Files](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html) and [DefinitelyTyped](http://definitelytyped.org/)
* Understand one way you can *sort of* simulate runtime type checking using TypeScript (type guards)
* Why are `switch` statements on union types often better than a traditional `if/else` ?
* Why should you avoid the `default case` on said `switch` statement ?
* Keep up to date on TypeScript releases
