# UI Framework - Mithril

Mithril is a small (~8kb) UI framework. Its main benefit is its simplicity by being just plain javascript. It has a built-in router and XHR!

## How do you prove it?

Prove it! By building a website (or component of a website) in Mithril. This may include the following concepts:

- Virtual DOM
- The component lifecycle
- Managing component state (ie. two-way data binding, XHR)
- Passing data between components
- Routing
- Show how you would test the components
- Show how you would do UI testing (with something like Cypress.io)

## How do you improve it?

Build something! But first, check out the [Mithril Docs](https://mithril.js.org/). It's one (of the only?) reference you'll need if you are already familiar with another framework such as React.js
