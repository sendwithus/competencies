# Competency - Language Python - Level 1
Python is a dynamic language that uses spaces for structured blocks of code.  Python is most used for Data Engineering/Data Science and Web Development.

## How do you prove it?
* You can explain to someone the differences between this language and another language.
* You have a good understanding of the resources and where to go if you're stuck.
* You understand how third party libraries are used, accessed, and installed.
* You have written and completed a demo-able project in this language.

## How do you improve it?
* Do Google's python class: [https://developers.google.com/edu/python/](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/)
* Write a lot of code

## Key points of research
* Differences between Python 2 and 3
* Pip (and other package managers)
* Third party libaries such as `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `pandas`, `numpy`, etc...

# Competency - Language Python - Level 2

## How do you prove it?
* For code you have submitted, your code reviews receive few syntactic corrections.
* You can write code from memory without having to look up how you use language specific features.
* You can describe the kinds of problems the language solves very well and the kinds of problems it's not a great fit for.
* You understand packaging paradigms for the language for both publishing and dependency management.
* You understand how to review third party libraries lifecycles and security implications.

## How do you improve it?
* Open many PRs
* Syntax conventions: Read the PEP8 style guide: [https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

## Key points of research
* Virtualenv
* [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv)
* List and dictionary comprehensions
* Global interpreter lock
* Lambdas
* async/await
