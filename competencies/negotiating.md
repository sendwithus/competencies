# Competency - Negotiating

Lots of the role of any manager is interacting with people that want things that you're not going to do.  Sales, customers, board members, team members.  This skill is needed so that you can disagree without hurting relationships, even strengthening them.

## How do you prove it?

It's tricky to prove that you're a good negotiator.  

In meetings you guide discussions and offer counter points.  You win people over by explaining things from their point of view.

You overcome belief systems using metaphor.

You preemptively know what most points of contention will be and how to undo those arguments.

## How do you improve it?
