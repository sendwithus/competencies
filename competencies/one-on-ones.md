# Competency - One on Ones

A key facet of working and leading a team is performing one on one check-ins with

members of your team. Typically this involves sitting down regularly (weekly)

with each person to talk about potential issues, discuss upcoming work, or

address any concerns or achievements. This skill is primarily about ensuring

that communication is flowing in and out of your team adequately.

## How do you prove it?

* Issues from folks you're responsible for are surfaced appropriately

* Team members feel comfortable chatting through issues

* You have a 6 month plan to help them in their careers which you reference in your one on ones

* You get good scores in your manager review.
