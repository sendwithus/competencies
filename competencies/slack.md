# Competency - Slack

Slack is an instant messaging platform built for business.  We use it internally to do lots and lots of our communication - so much so, that we hardly ever use email for internal communication.  

There are lots of channels and lots of noise in slack, so it is a good idea to become proficient in this tool. 

We value transparency, so as a rule, channels are mostly public and open to everyone and where it makes sense, we try to have conversations in public channels rather than DM'ing.

If there isn't a good channel to have this conversation, consider adding a new channel!
