# Competency - Successful Meetings

The value of meeting notes is that they capture the decisions, outcomes, and next steps.

Meeting notes will inform everyone who wasn't in the meeting about who was there, what the relevant document, and which slack channel the discussion will continue in. The most important thing meeting notes capture are the outcomes and next steps (who and what).

## What are the expectations?

**Planning Meetings**

A successful meeting always has:

* An agenda outlining the purpose of having the meeting, and the goals of the meeting. The agenda is shared in advance. 

* The right attendees as invited and as optional. If in doubt, mark the attendee as optional.

* A chair and a notetaker- ideally not the same person doing both. This can be decided at the beginning of the meeting.

* Meeting notes sent out after the meeting

    * Meeting notes aren't a long transcription of the meeting, or what was said. Rather, meeting notes capture two things: outcomes/decisions, and action items. That is: what did we decide, and what are we doing next to act on those decisions? See below.

* It is the responsibility of each attendee to review the agenda prior to the meeting and read the relevant material or topics. 

**Running Meetings**

Meetings are one of the most effective ways in which we work together. It's crucial that we ensure that we use the time well. 

* If you scheduled the meeting, you are the chair unless you've delegated this role to someone else

* It is up to the chair to ensure someone is taking notes

* It is the chair's responsibility to ensure that the meeting agenda items are covered and to be timekeeper

**Meeting Notes**

Here are the expectations for meeting notes:

* Must include:

    * Meeting topic and the agenda

    * Attendees

    * Date

    * **Action items/next steps**

    * **Decisions made**

    * Optional: more detailed notes. Keep in mind that meeting notes can be as simple as a photo of your notebook page with your handwritten action items! (Don't overthink it). 

* Meeting notes are shared with the attendees, but also with any stakeholder on the [RACI](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-rUFy-EBIfUtu76PEB6DZavOsu3VZYxj) chart for the project

* Meeting notes are easy to find for anyone interested who is looking for them (ideally, without having to ask)

* Shared same day as the meeting unless otherwise discussed with the group

* Ask yourself: if you were on vacation for a week and returned, would you be able to know that this meeting occurred and find the notes easily? 

## How do you improve it?

* If a meeting deviates from the agenda, review the structure of the meeting and enforce your agenda and timekeeping next time.

* Try out new approaches: 

    * Ask someone else to take notes so that you can run the meeting

* Ask for feedback on your meeting notes
