# Competency - Leading
Leaders lift up those around them, providing resources and direction to overcome obstacles.  They value the team and are the first to step up when there is a challenge that needs to be addressed.  They keep the sense of safety and trust in place between all members of the team.

Leading is about setting a good example, always doing your best to model proactive and productive interactions.

When things go wrong, a leader takes responsibility and doesn't blame others.  When things go right, a leader celebrates the team's win.

## How do you prove it?

* Your language reflects this attitude, when things go wrong you say "I screwed up" when things go right you say "the team did an amazing thing".

* In meetings when the team is unsure of what direction you step up to encourage a choice and take ownership of any problems that may occur down this path.

* You are trustworthy and reliable and folks don't have issue bringing things to you which is reflected in your peer reviews and manager reviews.

## How do you improve it?

* Have a mentor: someone that you're able to bounce ideas off of and talk through challenging situations with.
