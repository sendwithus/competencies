# Competency - Computer Vision

Computer vision is an essential prerequisite to become a Machine Learning Developer. Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects — and then react to what they “see.” Image and Video processing are two main principles that you should know in CV. In order to master computer vision, you should be an expert in OpenCV library which is one of the pillars on Computer Vision. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library which was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products.

## How do you prove it?

- You know in general how to use OpenCV for implementing mathematical functions on images and videos.

- You know the differences between OpenCV 3 and 4, the pros and cons of each of which.

- You know how to implement algorithms for Decision tree, Gradient boosting trees, K-nearest neighbors, K-means clustering, Naive Bayes classifier, Random forests, Support Vector Machines, and Deep Neural Networks in OpenCV.

- You know OpenCV Image Processing tools such as converting color spaces, geometric transformations, image thresholding, smoothing, morphological transformations, image gradients, edge detection functions, contours in images, image segmentation, image denoising (noise reduction), and histogram analysis.

- You know how to code a Deep Neural network from scratch using OpenCV.

- You know how to import previously developed Machine Learning models using OpenCV, modify them, improve them, and retrain them.
