# UI Framework - React

React is a popular UI library built by Facebook. It lets you build UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called components. 

React is just the view. It does not contain any models or controllers.

React is declarative. Your components are written around your application's state and React will only update and render the components it needs to.

Common components are exported and imported so that you are not writing duplicate code. This forms a component hierarchy where each component has its state and data flows one-way down the component hierarchy.

## How do you prove it?

You can build a website in React

You can explain the difference between a class component & a functional component

You can explain the difference between props, state, and children

You can explain life cycle methods and/or provide an example of one

You can explain when you would use a Fragment

You can explain what Context is

You can explain why you should use className instead of class

You can explain the need for a build tool and provide an example of one
