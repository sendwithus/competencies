# Competency - Design Tool Balsamiq

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) is a web-based mockup application used to build low fidelity UI wireframes. It simulates an experience and results similar to creating a wireframe with a physical pencil and paper. Its goal is to let you focus more on the content and layout instead of colors and fine details.

## How do you prove it?

You are able to get up and running by familiarizing yourself with Balsamiq's interface

Take an existing page and reverse create a wireframe for it

Create a component and extend it to multiple variations

Utilize frames and interactive actions to create a functional presentation (ie. a button that links to another frame when clicked)

## How do you improve it?

Reference the Balsamiq learn page found [here](https://balsamiq.com/learn/). It also includes UI wireframing theory.
