## How do you prove it?

People come to you and say things like, "I did this merge and now I'm in a tangle of branches and somebody did a force push and now I'm stuck", and you can calmly untangle the knot. This can involve solving merge-conflicts, cherry-picking commits from other branches, and rebasing.

You can explain how Git hashing works and explain the pros and cons in relation to other version control systems such as SVN and Mercurial.

You can explain and use pre and post hooks.

You understand and can modify configuration in .git/config.

## How do you improve it?

Read ALL the Git manual - ([https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)) and build prototypes.

Read blogs about people doing weird things to Git (like using it as a database - [https://www.kenneth-truyers.net/2016/10/13/git-nosql-database/](https://www.kenneth-truyers.net/2016/10/13/git-nosql-database/)) 

Try experimenting in Git.

Build your own Git aliases.

Clean a repository's history of all files larger than 200kb.

~/.gitconfig add `autocorrect = -1` turns on autocorrect on your Git commands. So `git statsu` --> `git status` automatically.  :
