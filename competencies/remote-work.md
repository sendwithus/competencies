# Competency - Remote Work

As distinct from working from home, remote work is when your primry workspace is away from the main office.
Like during a pandemic.

- Remote work is hard!  It requires a lot of discipline, time management, internal motivation.
- Remote work is glorious!  It gives you unprecedented, uninterrupted time to get work done,
and you get to choose all the snacks.


## How do you prove it?

- You have a fast, reliable internet connection/power, show us your speed test.
- You have a quiet area to work free from interruptions and noise.
- You are available on slack/email/etc... during work hours.  Available means different things to different roles,
talk to your manager about their expectations for your availability.
- You have a working headset and good audio.  In conference calls people don't tell you that you're breaking up or
they can't hear you.
- You have a working webcam and good lighting for video.  The attention needed for attending a video conference
should be the same as meeting someone across the table.
- You are proficient in using video conferencing apps; mute/unmute audio, turn video on/off, share screen
- You are responsive to your colleagues.  Again, responsive means different things to different roles,
check with your manager.
- You can explain why you should switch to a video chat, as opposed to slack, as opposed to Asana.
When to use these mediums and when not to.
- You know how to unblock your tasks and can describe who you go to in various situations.

## How do you improve it?

- Plan your entire week to the best of your ability.  Planning allows you to remain focused,
and not be distracted by the scores of personal projects at home.
- Block off sections of your calendar to ensure you manage your weekly workload.
- Use calendar plugin to automatically set meeting status in Slack
- Proactively setting status in Slack for short breaks like, out to lunch, be-right-back, etc
- Tell your team about extended break like, walk the dog be back in an hour, dental appointment be back at 2, etc
- When you have a chance to visit the office, make it count, make it known to everyone that you are in the office.
Pack your schedule for meeting people in person. Make a point to greet and meet, even if it is just a walk by.

## Examples of remote worker schedules.

### Example 1:
On Sunday I review the week ahead, and check for meeting double bookings, and reschedule things that need to be.

I pull in the work for the week that I hope to get done and schedule some large blocks of time in my calendar that
I can do that work in.

Each day, I get up at 5:30am PT to be on time for the 9am start in ET, and as much overlap with Poland as possible.

I process all my inbound - capture task from slack / email into my task management in asana, and respond and
unblock as many projects / people before the first meeting.

I check my calendar and make sure I have prep time for each meeting, if I don't I do the prep time as a first step in
the day.

I check my task list for the weeks work and remind myself of the critical projects I'm responsible for.

In the first gap in my calendar is where I take my shower, and I also use that time to think strategically about the
rest of the day - "what is the best thing I could work on next".  As opposed to the morning where I have mostly been
reactive and trying to unblock as many things as possible.

I finish my day at roughly 2pm PT but am available on slack till around 5pm PT for the rest of the team.

### Example 2:
I wake up at my regular time of 6am CT

Instead of showering as I would when going ot the office I just go to my home office and catch up on any reminders
I set and do some reading, I often read a chapter or two in a book, a relevant business book.

My day flows from there as more people get online and discussions and meetings start.

I used a free hour around lunch to go for a 30 minute run, 10 minute cooldown and shower and eat lunch
(I typically eat leftovers and lunch is about fuel for me so it's minutes of time)

Then the afternoon is all about meetings or projects, if an important project I will have blocked time.

I finish my day at roughly 4pm CT depending on meetings.
