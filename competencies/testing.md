# Competency - Testing

Testing, in development terms, really is about confidence in your code, and the codebase of the product in general. Different testing methodologies cover different aspects of a system. If code is changed, that causes a regression in functionality, tests that were passing should fail.

A developer should write code with testing in mind and see testing as an integral part of developing code, not as a separate step or afterthought. 

*If you have good tests, you will get good rests. ~ anonymous*

## How do you prove it?

You produce code that has a high percentage of test coverage, and those tests are trusted, readable, maintainable.

The code you write is modular and testable because of it.  Or modular because it's testable. 

Your code rarely causes a regression from features added, or other bugs fixed.

You know the difference between manual, unit, integration, blackbox, whitebox, happy path, boundary, smoke, user and regression testing and understand the benefits, boundaries and costs of them and how best to apply these methods to reach their goals..
