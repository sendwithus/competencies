# Competency - SQL

Structured Query Language is a domain-specific language used in programming and primarily designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. This competency is geared to the actual SQL language and not SQL relational databases. Complementary to this competency, you should also achieve competency in the RDBMS or other system (systems outside of RDBMS, like Hive and Spark use SQL ) you are using SQL on. Learning the language is only the first step.

## How do you improve it?

Practice! Start by downloading a database management application such as [Sequel Pro](https://www.sequelpro.com/) for mac or [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) for windows. Of course you can also do everything through the command line! See a list of commonly used commands in this [cheet sheet](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-cheat-sheet.aspx)
