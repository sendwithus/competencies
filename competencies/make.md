# Competency - make

Make is a build automation tool that automatically builds executable programs
and libraries by reading files called `Makefiles`. Besides building programs,
Make can be used to manage any project where some files must be updated automatically
from others whenever the others change.  

## How do you prove it?

* For code you have submitted, your code reviews get little syntactic corrections
* You understand target order execution
* You can write multiline commands and understand what are implications of make executing each line in separate shell
* You understand what is phony target
* You can use Variables
* You can use Wildcard
* You can write Functions
* You can present a makefile you have

## How do you improve it?
