# Competency - Time Management

There is lots of work to do and you will be asked to do more work than you have time. However, it is your responsibility
to recognise that you have limited time and what to do when your workload is greater than your available time.

## How do you prove it?

- Your calendar has chunks of time for commited large tasks of work.  
- Your calendar is always up to date.
- Your holidays are planned out in advance and you have dealt with the meetings that happen on those days appropriately.
- You are able to guage how much work you will complete in a week and have examples of when you had to push back against new 
tasks.
- You have a method for tracking projects so that they don't dangle when tasks are completed.
- You can talk about examples of effectively delegating tasks to others.
- You don't regularly work weekends or after hours or when you do it is specifically on tasks that will free up more time in the future.
