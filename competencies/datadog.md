# Competency - Datadog

Datadog is a monitoring platform used both for tracing of work done inside an application as well as metrics pushed by infrastructure, CI systems and more.

Datadog is essential to being a competent debugger. We also use this for logging and APM (application performance monitoring).

## How do you prove it?

* You can successfully interpret a trace and explain the levels and how to read a trace.

* You can configure a tracing implementation in a Go or Javascript project.

* You can describe what each of our alarms does and how to respond to it. A sufficient response can be who to escalate to.

* You can add a new alert via Terraform.

* You can successfully search for logs through the datadog logs dashboard.

## How do you improve it?

* Investigate fires and spurious alarms, submit a report to sourcery on-call and describe how an alarm can be improved.

* Dig into application traces to investigate a picture of the application that your team runs.
