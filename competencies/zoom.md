You can find the meeting link in a meeting you have started.
You can mute people on the line.
You can share your screen.
You can make someone else on the call the presenter.

## How do you improve it?

Install the Zoom Chrome Scheduler, that adds a "Zoom" button when you're making a calendar event and will dump in your meeting details: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zoom-scheduler/kgjfgplpablkjnlkjmjdecgdpfankdle?hl=en-US](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zoom-scheduler/kgjfgplpablkjnlkjmjdecgdpfankdle?hl=en-US)

There is an option to unmute the mic when you hold down space which is useful if you're in a loud environment to stop background noise flooding the call.
