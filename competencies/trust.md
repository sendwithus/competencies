# Competency - Trust

Trust is the foundation of any working relationship. Trust allows coworkers to work on projects and tasks together and know that the other is doing exactly what they need to. 

This competency is how you build trust in a team.

## How do you prove it?

Your peer reviews / manager reviews prove this out.

You can show examples of cross department communication and building openess.

You have admitted failure and shown learning and growth from it.

You have listened empathically and without blame when somebody else is admitting a failure.

You never lose your temper (being angry is fine, but acting angrily is not)

## How do you improve it?

Work with other departments.

Learn how to communicate empathically.

Be dependendable and do the things you say you will.
