# Competency - Interviewing

Interviewing is the act of meeting a potential candidate with the intention of evaluating their fit for a potential opening or opportunity within the company.

Interviews themselves can take a few different forms, but often they involve a face to face meeting with a new person. 


## How do you prove it?

* You have shadowed several interviews of all different types

* You have reviewed resumes and can articulate why you have chosen to exclude the ones that didn't meet the grade.

* You have shown that during an interview you can follow up on interesting responses and go deeper into a specific answer.

* Your high score candidates, end up being successful in the company.

* In hiring reviews after the interview is complete you can articulate why you gave the score you did.

* You can talk about the various biases in hiring and what to do about them.

## How do you improve it?

* Perform interviews with other experienced interviewers

* Study up on good interview questions within the problem space you're hiring for, such as the following HTML front end question list: [https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions)
