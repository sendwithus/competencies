# Competency - Interviewing

Interviewing is the act of meeting a potential candidate with the intention of evaluating their fit for a potential opening or opportunity within the company.

Interviews themselves can take a few different forms, but often they involve a face to face meeting with a new person. Our process for engineer interviews at Sendwithus has typically been to provide an exercise or talking point ahead of time that the candidate can work on or think about. When they come in for the discussion we then talk through their approach and try to identify any weak spots, evaluating how the candidate responds to feedback and whether they've thought through the problem space completely. Another option that some folk advocate for is doing pair coding interviews where the candidate is paired up with someone from the company. Either way, the end goal is to have a discussion around a potential real problem space, to explore how capably the situation is handled.

* You're also able to ask challenging questions that help uncover problem spots

* Your high score candidates, end up being successful in the company.

* Your low score candidates, if hired, are statistically removed from the company early.

* You can reference internal benchmarks of excellence for the roles your hire for without these benchmarks being affected by external influences.
