# Competency - Writing

Being able to communicate well is one of the most important skills you can develop.
Your great ideas do you no good if no one else understands them. Whether you are
writing documentation or delivering a presentation, the following are essential:

## How do you prove it?

* You have 3 examples of long form communication that show examples from the improve it section.

## How do you improve it?

* **Know Your Audience** - Who you are communicating to should have a significant impact
on how you communicate. 
    * How much do they already know? 
    * Are they technical or business focused? 
    * What level of detail are they interested in? What questions will they have?
    * What is the outcome you are looking for?
    * How long should it take to go through this?

* **Keep It Succinct** - No matter what you are communicating, keep it as simple as possible
(but no simpler). Present insights, not just raw data. Don't make your audience have to 
do work in order to understand your point. 

* **Make It Pretty** - No one likes reading a wall of text. Use bolding/underlining/colors
to call out important points. If visualizations can be used to better present information, 
use them. Use (properly labelled) charts if presenting a lot of numbers.

* **Tell A Story** - Whatever you are communicating will be more engaging if it fits into a
narrative.  Once you know your audience, the narrative you construct should relate to 
their context and answer questions they will have. Each piece of information presented 
should be geared to achieving the goal of your documentation.
* Solicit feedback (and incorporate it)
