# Competency - Triage

Triage is the act of filtering incoming product related tasks.  Rejecting things that should not be considered and fleshing out the things that should be considered.

## How do you prove it?

At any point after 10am your triage list has been completely processed.

Everyone in the company trusts the triage process and understands the timelines and how to escalate.

Everyone in the company knows the expected format (even if they don't use it) of feature ideas and bug reports.

When new ideas are rejected the rejectee understands why this is not making it into the product and you reject them in a way that doesn't hurt their feelings and leaves them wanting to contribute more.

## How do you improve it?

Learn various productivity tools.  I like GTD: [https://gettingthingsdone.com/](https://gettingthingsdone.com/)  GTD+Asana: [https://community.asana.com/t/do-you-use-the-getting-things-done-gtd-method/119](https://community.asana.com/t/do-you-use-the-getting-things-done-gtd-method/119)

Schedule time in your calendar for triage and defend it from everything.  

Have a strong definition of what a bug / story is.

Have the [negotiating competency](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dno3YixqTNAMPRpPntPLXp9q71HiV4qC9BahG2KgDUQ/edit)
