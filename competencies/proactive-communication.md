# Competency - Proactive Communication

Communication is foundational to what product management is, and being an effective PM requires continual investment into effective communication. Product managers have outstanding communication skills, coupled with proactive behaviours and positive mindset.

## How do you prove it?


## How do you improve it?

* Always communicate the "why" behind every decision. This is the most crucial thing.

* Communicate early, and often. Repeat yourself until everyone remembers. 

* Own the success of every meeting you attend, even if you aren't the chair. If you see no one taking meeting notes, take on that role and share them with attendees. If you think a stakeholder is missing, invite them. Etc. 

* Reply to every email you receive and every task where you're mentioned within 24 hours. And if you don't have the answer required yet, simply respond by saying "I'll get back to you on <day/time>". 

* Ask how you can help the team. Seek out answers by making suggestions. This is a powerful way to build trust, stay in the loop, and keep a micro (as well as macro) view of projects. 

* Keep a positive outlook, and try not to have anything bad to say. This is often easier said than done, but if you have a positive attitude, it's infectious. Product management is about leadership and your optimism, positive outlook, and initiative are crucial. Another aspect of this is framing every bit of communication around a positive. Instead of saying things like, "if you missed out on yesterday's meeting", why not go with "We want to keep you updated about yesterday's meeting". The difference is subtle but important. 

* Own stakeholder alignment. Take the lead on fostering a productive working relationship with other teams, from sales to marketing to CS. Having open communication with other teams means you'll hear about ideas from others, and you'll work together more effectively. 

* Ask for feedback regularly. Ask stakeholders from your team but also from other teams. 

* Invest time into the basics
