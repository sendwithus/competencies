# Competency - ML Framework - Scikit Learn

If you are a Python programmer or you are looking for a robust library you can use to bring machine learning into a production system then a library that you will want to seriously consider is scikit-learn. It provides a range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms via a consistent interface in Python. It is licensed under a permissive simplified BSD license and is distributed under many Linux distributions, encouraging academic and commercial use. The library is built upon the SciPy (Scientific Python) that must be installed before you can use scikit-learn. This stack that includes NumPy - Base n-dimensional array package, SciPy - Fundamental library for scientific computing, Matplotlib - Comprehensive 2D/3D plotting and visualization, IPython - Enhanced interactive console, Sympy - Symbolic mathematics, and Pandas - Data structures and analysis.

## How do you prove it?

- You know the advantages of using Scikit-learn over other DL frameworks.

- You know how to install scikit-learn on your local or cloud machine using PIP and Anaconda.

- You know where to use `scikit-learn` and where to use `sklearn` in your code. (fun fact)

- You know how to define, build, develop, and implement classification algorithms such as support vector machines, nearest neighbors, random forests, and Bayesian networks for visual and text applications.

- You know how to build and develop regression algorithms such as support vector regression for numerical data.

- You know how to design clustering algorithms such as k-means, spectral, fuzzy c-means, mean-shift on numerical data.

- You have strong background in using dimensionality reduction algorithms such as principal component analysis.

- You know how to use model selection algorithms such as cross validation and grid search on numerical and visual data.

- You know how to preprocess your data using scikit-learn (feature extraction, normalization, data cleaning, etc.)

- You know how to build and develop neural networks (for supervised and unsupervised applications) using scikit-learn.

- You know how to use scikit-learn for parallelism and resource management in your ML application.
