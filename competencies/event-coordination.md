# Competency - Event Coordination

We run events, a lot of events. THe two most important events are Startup Slam and Battlesnake. 

## How do you prove it?

You can schedule and run hosted events and meetups. 

You make sure that the space is set up and ready for any groups who need it and that all contracts have been signed.

Either yourself, or another SWUbie has been designated the contact for the event. 

Event is promoted/documented for future promotion.

## How do you improve it?

You run and coordinate larger events i.e. Startup Slam and Battlesnake. 

All volunteers have designated jobs and teams.

Specific volunteers have been designated trouble shooters for specific issues (wifi, tech, food, etc.)

Every event has a measureable goal/metric to determine success

Community partners are brought in to increase exposure and success

More attendees come year over year.
