# Competency - Documentation

This may include writing and sharing effective and actionable documentation, or working with other stakeholders to ensure that it is captured and shared. 

This includes ensuring documentation is thorough, actionable, and up-to-date. (To mitigate the bus factor). Documentation includes, but is not limited to:

1. **Product and Project Documentation** - Creating (and contributing to) comprehensive product briefs, tasks, as well as writing reports. It also includes sharing relevant insights to the team and its stakeholders, and analyzing and sharing the impact of the team's work (in the form of:reports, demos, or other updates).

2. **Planning** - Ensuring meetings have agendas, that meeting outcomes and action items are shared, and that decisions are documented and shared to the right audience (see [Meetings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BEy7wT-mjwlHqDcLlQrM2KIhLCrOhXYuH1pab07-oR4/edit#heading=h.u3t50bkxhjfj)).

3. **Competitive analysis** - Maintaining thorough and up-to-date knowledge of the competitive landscape, with notes on relevant developments or news that are available to other product managers and to the team (see [Competitive Analysis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12NXequjWFGI6gks16f-gPL1gu8vgDaBk3LCDTg80qOg/edit#)).

## How do you prove it?

- You can show many different examples of clear, concise, usable documentation.
- You can articulate where the best place for a given document is.

## How do you improve it?

Write yourself out of the job. You must be able to go on vacation, which means that the people with whom you work can find answers to questions without having to ask you. Document everything: process, decisions, as well as product requirements. Share early and often.

**Documentation Basics**

Here are a few things to do as you go along:

* Ensure the project document links to all related documents, including:

    * Meeting notes with the date (see [Meetings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BEy7wT-mjwlHqDcLlQrM2KIhLCrOhXYuH1pab07-oR4/edit#heading=h.u3t50bkxhjfj))

    * Older or other related product briefs or tasks

    * Non-product  or engineering docs

    * The point of contact/RACI

    * Cross-linking: where's the Asana board? What other place might someone go looking for this information? 

**Tracking the work**

Ensuring that we have actionable and accessible documentation is an integral part of what product can contribute to our company's ability to build winning products. Our goal is to ensure that we can go on vacation knowing that everyone with whom we work has the information they need to get to "done". This includes (but isn't limited to):

* Each task is linked to a parent epic

* Each task follows a template format to ensure that we don't overlook important information This includes the link to the spec. 

* The what/why/how of every task is captured in the body (and not the comments, where they can get lost)

* Each task is groomed. The purpose is grooming is to get consensus from the teams (typically, product, design, and engineering) that we all have the information we believe we need at this point to complete the work. (Sometimes things come up while we're doing the implementation, and that's fine, but let's try to catch as many dependencies, risks, and questions during grooming). 

* Read up on why documentation matters so much:

    * Atlassian's PRD: [https://www.atlassian.com/agile/requirements](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/requirements)

    * ["You are as smart as your stories"](https://www.fastcompany.com/3015928/engineering-flow-planning-for-high-velocity-sprints-part-3)

    * [Josh Elman on what product management is and what PMs do](https://news.greylock.com/let-s-talk-about-product-management-d7bc5606e0c4)

* Observe the day-to-day during the sprint. What questions came up? Could they have been captured in the tasks? Did stakeholders ask questions we could have anticipated and answered earlier?

* Make time every sprint to review the documentation you have to ensure it's up-to-date and accessible.
