# Competency - Owning the Product Roadmap

The product roadmap is a 6 month to 1 year projection of where the product will be at that time.  Timelines shorter than six months are tactical and dealt with by the product backlog.

## How do you prove it?

All departments of the organization have a good understanding of the six month - 1 year roadmap as you have made this knowledge available to them through presentations, emails, working groups and one on one chats.

Your 6 month projections are accurate and can be relied on to come in on time and deliver value.

You can easily frame ideas and suggestions from stakeholders against the roadmap.
