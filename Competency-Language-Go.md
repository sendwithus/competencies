# Competency - Language Go<br />Go (often referred to as golang for googling purposes) is a programming language created at Google in 2009 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is a compiled, statically typed language in the tradition of Algol and C, with garbage collection, limited structural typing, memory safety features and CSP-style concurrent programming features added. The compiler and other language tools originally developed by Google are all free and open source.<br />Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)<br />Home: https://golang.org/<br />How do you prove it?<br />For code you have submitted, your code reviews get few syntactic corrections.<br />You can write code from memory without having to look up how you use language specific features.<br />You can explain to someone the differences, advantages and disadvantages of this language in comparison to others.<br />You can describe the kinds of problem the language solves very well and the problems it?s not a great fit for.<br />You understand packaging paradigms for the language.<br />You have a good understanding of the resources and where to go if you?re stuck.<br />You understand how third party libraries are used, access, their lifecycle and security implications.<br />You understand the testing frameworks of this language, and have the ability to describe the idiomatic ways of doing tasks with the language.<br />How do you improve it?<br />Do the tutorial: https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1<br />Read the docs: https://golang.org/doc/ <br />Memorize the cheat sheet: https://github.com/a8m/go-lang-cheat-sheet/blob/master/golang_refcard.pdf<br />Understand package management: https://github.com/golang/dep <br />Build some software.<br />Attend Gophercon https://www.gophercon.com/<br /><br />Learn best practices: <br />https://blog.chewxy.com/2018/03/18/golang-interfaces/<br />
