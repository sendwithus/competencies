Competency - Docker<br />All of our Dyspatch system is deployed in docker containers.  <br />Docker is a software technology providing containers, promoted by the company Docker, Inc. Docker provides an additional layer of abstraction and automation of operating-system-level virtualization on Windows and Linux (and most x86 hardware).  Docker uses the resource isolation features of the Linux kernel such as cgroups and kernel namespaces, and a union-capable file system such as OverlayFS and others to allow independent "containers" to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines (VMs).<br />Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software) <br />Home: https://www.docker.com/ <br />How do you prove it?<br />You can explain what docker is architecturally good for and how it operates.<br />You can talk intelligently about best practices and common pitfalls.<br />You understand and can explain the security issues around docker.<br />You understand various container registries usage.<br />You understand how to connect containers and ports, and expose ports through/to the host machine.<br />How do you improve it?<br />Do a tutorial: https://docker-curriculum.com/<br />Memorize a docker cheat sheet: https://github.com/wsargent/docker-cheat-sheet<br />Learn the AWS container registry: https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/<br /><br />
