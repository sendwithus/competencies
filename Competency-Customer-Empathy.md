# Competency - Customer Empathy

Customer empathy is the ability to put yourself in the customer's metaphorical shoes and understand why it is the way they feel. If we didn't understand the customer then we wouldn't really know what problems they have and how we can solve them.

## How do you prove it?

You understand why a user might be frustrated?

The questions you ask help get to the root of the problem

You feel ownership for any bugs and pain you have mistakenly caused

You consistently get positive reviews from your customer feedback mechanisms.

## How do you improve it?

- Practice active listening: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_listening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_listening) 

- Join in support check-in with the CS team at ~5:00PM PST

- Attend an account check-in with Account Management rep

- Use the product and see where you get stuck.

- Before answering something, ask yourself, how would you want to be treated.
