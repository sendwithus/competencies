# Competency - Coding<br />Coding is separate from a language you code in.  Coding competency are the surrounding parts of building code.  How ergonomic are you with your computer, your IDE or editor.  <br />It?s about your ability to write maintainable code and how you follow, and understand standards. It?s that little bit of desire for order that won?t let you write badly formatted, or tightly coupled code. A coder understands when to conform to the existing standards in a code base, and when to deviate or refactor.<br />How do you prove it?<br />You can input code through the keyboard competently, and smoothly and mostly without typographic error.<br />You understand and can discuss the variances in syntax structures between languages such as compiled/scripting, typed/untyped languages, whitespace structure (python) vs {} blocked structure, object oriented/procedural/functional.<br />You can translate thoughts and ideas into coding patterns that other developers will recognise.<br />You can refactor code quickly without introducing semantic differences in the code.<br />You can read other (decent) code and understand its functionality.<br />How do you improve it?<br />Read coding style books<br />Learn about patterns<br />Learn about anti-patterns<br />Try several different IDEs<br />Learn to type<br />Try not to use a mouse for a full day so you can fully appreciate how much faster you can work with keyboard shortcuts.<br /><br /><br />
