Competency - Fire Triaging
Be part of the monitoring team that triages production emergencies.

This competency requires:
Good debugging and prioritization skills
A strong desire to have a healthy, well monitored, easy to debug system
A strong understanding of the infrastructure and data paths within
A good understanding of where to find all different types of logs within the system
Work outside of normal office hours (as such it comes with a increase in base pay)
A data/cell connection (as such we cover, within reason, phone plans) 

Sub-Competencies:
linux/bash
Kubedash
How do you prove it?
Alerting Knowledge
You have a good understanding of (and can discuss):

different categories of alerts.
differences in categorizations for each product
Debugging/Tracing
Given very little data, you have a good priority of where/what details to get (and how).
You can have an egoless discussion about the state of infrastructure and code.
You understand the types of errors that could occur, given symptoms, and could give likelihoods on them, along with how to prove/disprove each theory.
You are able to view system resource usage of each heroku dyno in Sendwithus
Prioritization
You can prioritize between different types of bugs, given very little data on the bugs.
You can find out more about the bugs through various monitoring and debugging techniques.
You can delegate, and know who to delegate too.
Tooling
You know the reason for, and how to use: 

Sendwithus:
OpsGenie
Sentry
Papertrail
Librato
NewRelic
Heroku

OpsGenie
Sentry
Datadog
Cloudwatch Logs

How do you improve it?
Read the wiki doc about fire handling: https://github.com/techdroplabs/wiki-sourcery/blob/master/procedures/fires/fire-handling.md
You need to be able to identify alerts and figure out who to wake up: https://github.com/techdroplabs/wiki-sourcery/blob/master/procedures/fires/escalation.md
