# Engineering - Team Lead

## What it's like to be a team lead
We believe in a servant leadership, with team leads helping to enable their teams build the best software they can in the fastest and safest way possible.
Team leads are responsible for managing their team as well as leading them.  Leading the way in which software is built and helping the developers grow in their careers.
