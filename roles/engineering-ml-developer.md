# Engineering - Machine Learning Developer
<welcome.snippet/>

## What it's like to be an ML Developer
As an ML developer, your role comprises of two main parts; research and coding. For most projects you should make a comprehensive research on the most recent and relevant state-of-the-art models which can be helpful. It can be either reconstructing the model from published academic papers or designing the model from scratch.

You should have a strong background in mathematics as the whole machine learning science is built upon mathematical and statistical models. You have strong understanding of big data and data science, as they are essential requirements for your role. In most of the projects you may need to go over the present data, clean them, sort them, and make them compatible with ML models to be trained on. You build code and contribute to the current projects, and whenever you are stuck, or you need ideas from others, you drag over a colleague to show off what you built and get feedback and input. You are eager to accept feedback and improve your design of the code. You should always be ready to provide a proof of concept and present it as a demo to the product owner and upon approval from them, deploy into staging for internal and external testing, and when everything is successful in staging env, you deploy the service to production. Creating a machine learning service is always a loop, as you need to monitor the service after deploying and often times try to enhance and improve the model by retraining it. You always should be scared of data drifting and be confident that your model is working properly.
You always should document your built services and micro services as internal docs for the team and blog posts for clients and users. You are responsible for writing up tests for your code, such as unit tests, integration, stress tests, etc. For every project you should plot the project diagram in the most accurate way in Miro in order for other team mates to be able to learn it and contribute to it.

Again, you always research, and if in some steps of your project you are stuck and no one in the team is not able to help, you do external research in the open source world.
