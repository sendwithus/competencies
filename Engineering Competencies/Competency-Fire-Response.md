## How do you prove it?

### Debugging/Tracing

Given very little data, you have a good priority of where/what details to get (and how).

You can have an egoless discussion about the state of infrastructure and code.

You understand the types of errors that could occur, given symptoms, and could give likelihoods on them, along with how to prove/disprove each theory.

### Prioritization

You are able to review an incident, understand its affect on customers, and suggest short term and/or long term fixes along with mitigation strategies.

### Tooling

You know the reason for, and how to use: 

Sendwithus:

* NewRelic

* Heroku

Dyspatch:

* OpsGenie

* Sentry

* Datadog

* Cloudwatch Logs

### Training

You have shadowed 2 fire duty rotations.

You have been on 1 fire duty rotation solo.

You have confidence, your managers confidence, and the fire lead's confidence to be on rotation

### John Filter

The fire duty lead (John) has signed off on your ability to do fire duty.
