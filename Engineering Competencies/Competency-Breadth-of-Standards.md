# Competency - Breadth of Standards

Standards such as programming language standards, protocol standards, data structure standards, accessibility standards, security standards, compliance standards.

## How do you prove it?

When posed with a problem you can instinctively tell when there is probably research work to be done on the surrounding standards, when to enforce them and when to be flexible.

You have a sense of whether a standard will be adopted.

You know common standards bodies and what they represent and why they came into being in the first place.

## How do you improve it?
