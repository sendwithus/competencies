# Competencies

Sendwithus has built out a list of internal competency documents that describe many of the skills you need to succeed here.
We wanted to open source these documents so that other organizations can use them as a starting point for career development and compensation conversations.

Sendwithus bundles these competencies into role definition documents that have a list of all the competencies you need to excel in that role.  These role documents were not published here as they contain a lot of Sendwithus specific information that would make re-use difficult.

## Publishing Process
Sendwithus stores our competencies in Google drive internally and we decided against giving access directly to those documents as it increases our security attack surface in a way that we're unable to manage effectively at this time.  Instead, we have a synchronization process that takes our internal competency documents and pushes them into a public github repository (this one) as a pull request at a frequency of about once a week or whenever there are changes, whichever is less frequent.

## Pull Request process
Currently, we don't accept PRs from the community on this repository.  We wanted to try and accomplish bringing changes back from the community, but the merging process back to Google drive was considered unweildy.  So, at this time, we have a publish only process that you can sync from the upstream fork whenever there are changes.  
If you have a proposal for a whole new competency please add it in the form of a GitHub issue with a link to a public Gist that we can collaborate on without having to merge.

## Competency Document Structure

Each competency document is broken into three sections.

### Title and Description
A brief overview of what the skill is.  For example `Git and Github` is the title of the competency and technology we use for version control.

### How do you prove it?
A section detailing how you would prove to your direct manager that you have this competency.  What is that manager going to look for to verify this skill.  This section is by far the most challenging as sometimes the task will be a technical skill that the manager doesn't have.  Or it might a soft skill like `One on Ones` that requires feedback from the employees team members.

### How do you improve it?
This is the section that lists of resources to improve this skill set.  This section tends to grow over time as tribal knowledge can be captured and stored here.
