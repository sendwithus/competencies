# Competency - Mentoring

Mentoring is all about sharing knowledge. Typically one person who is highly skilled will work with someone who is still improving to help them accelerate their knowledge in a particular domain. 

Mentoring can take many forms. Pairing is one example, where folks will physically be together in one place and time, working through a problem together. Typically while pairing one person will "drive" and do the work while the second person provides direction and feedback, and then the two will switch back and forth regularly. However, mentoring can also be done more asynchronously and span a greater length of time. Code reviews are a good example where the mentoring happens with regular small bits of feedback rather than all at once.

Mentoring has a lot of overlap with leading, but can be done at a more microscopic scale with one on one interactions and check-ins.

## How do you prove it?

* You have a mentee who reports that they have improved significantly in one or more areas that they wanted to.

* You're able to give constructive criticism; you have a way of providing feedback that is useful and informative without too much nitpicking. 

* You meet people where they're at with little expectation for where they should be - you have mentees in various stages of development and able to recognise that point and grow them effectively from there.

* You enjoy helping others and lending support and have lots of examples of where you have done mentoring.

* Mentoring often requires a low amount of ego: your willing to share your work with others even if not refined. Conversely, you're able to help others refine their approaches.

* You have little ego - you celebrate your failures, and weaknesses to demonstrate that learning is part of being vulnerable.

## How do you improve it?

* Establish some baseline rules around the mentorship relationship, setting clear expectations around what both sides will get out of the relationship.

* Work on listening skills and empathy

* Schedule time to do mentoring work.  A lot of mentoring is giving over time and the mentee will rarely ask for it.

* Volunteer for mentor positions - Ladies learning code, VicJS, Concat Meetup, HackUVic, BattleSnake, etc?.
