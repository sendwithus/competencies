Quality Assurance (QA) Automation, is structures to automatically run test suites. The speed and coverage of these tests affect the confidence developers have in the functionality of the changed code. 

## How do you prove it?

You're familiar with a range of testing methodologies and can describe their benefits and pitfalls, including: manual, unit, integration, blackbox, whitebox, happy path, boundary, smoke, and user testing.

You typically define your acceptance tests and e2e tests as part of your ticket definition.  

You understand how to build UI components that lend themselves to non-brittle e2e tests.
