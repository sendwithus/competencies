# Competency - Manager Hiring

Hiring is a multi-stage process that includes networking, prospecting, interviewing, and evaluation, all before an offer is even made. You need to have a keen sense of what skills your team already has, and how to assess someone new for the perspectives and abilities they'll bring to the team. This requires at least a moderate competency in the skill-set you may be hiring for so you're able to at least "talk the talk" and ?cut the wheat from the chaff?. (Or from an alternate perspective, you need to know how to detect lies.) Once the new team member has been invited, the next phase to prepare for involves training and mentoring.

## How do you prove it?

* You are a holistic view of the company, with strong interpersonal skills and the ability to collaborate cross team effectively that give you a broad appreciation of the things that are important to work here.

* You participate in community events and frequently "put yourself out there" to meet new and interesting potential applicants.

* You're able to ask the right questions to evaluate a person's skills

* You already are capable at the "interviewing" competency.

## How do you improve it?

* Attend network events

* Join/pair with other more experienced hiring managers

* Attend diversity events

* Be open to identifying personal biases that may cause you to overlook certain candidates
