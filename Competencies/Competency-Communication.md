# Competency - Communication

If people are the only asset in an organization, the communications between people is the only way to accomplish anything.  Good communication is critical.

## How do you prove it?

**Meetings**

Your meetings are scheduled with agendas.

When you speak at meetings you're aware of all the different levels of understanding and can talk to this.

You tell people what you are going to tell them, you tell them, and then you tell them what you told them.

**One on one**

You are clear and concise and track things back to make sure a full comprehension has been accomplished.  You listen to other people's point of view and make them feel heard and understood before launching your track.

**Slack / Email / Asana / Drive Comments / etc? **

Your electronic communications are respectful and effective.  You topload questions with possible answers and outcomes for each of the answers to prevent lots of back and forth.
