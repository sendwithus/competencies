# Competency - Communication

If people are the only asset in an organization, the communications between people is the only way to accomplish anything.  Good communication is critical.

## How do you prove it?

**Meetings**

Your meetings are scheduled with agendas.

When you speak at meetings you're aware of all the different levels of understanding and can talk to this.

You tell people what you are going to tell them, you tell them, and then you tell them what you told them.

**One on one**

You are clear and concise and track things back to make sure a full comprehension has been accomplished.  You listen to other people's point of view and make them feel heard and understood before launching your track.

**Slack / Email / Asana / Drive Comments / etc? **

Your electronic communications are respectful and effective.  You topload questions with possible answers and outcomes for each of the answers to prevent lots of back and forth.

Make people feel heard: It's important for diffusing conversations that the person you're talking to hears you hearing them.

**Avoiding Airplane Crashes type communication**

Five steps:

- Opening or attention getter - Address the individual: "Hey Chief," or "Captain Smith," or "Bob," or whatever name or title will get the person's attention.
- State your concern - Express your analysis of the situation in a direct manner while owning your emotions about it. "I'm concerned that we may not have enough fuel to fly around this storm system," or "I'm worried that the roof might collapse."
- State the problem as you see it - "We're showing only 40 minutes of fuel left," or "This building has a lightweight steel truss roof, and we may have fire extension into the roof structure."
- State a solution - "Let's divert to another airport and refuel," or "I think we should pull some tiles and take a look with the thermal imaging camera before we commit crews inside."
- Obtain agreement (or buy-in) - "Does that sound good to you, Captain?"
