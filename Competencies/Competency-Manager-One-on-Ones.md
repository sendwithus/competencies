# Competency - Manager One on Ones

A key facet of working and leading a team is performing one on one check-ins with

members of your team. Typically this involves sitting down regularly (weekly)

with each person to talk about potential issues, discuss upcoming work, or

address any concerns or achievements. This skill is primarily about ensuring

that communication is flowing in and out of your team adequately.
