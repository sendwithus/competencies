# Competency - Email

Email at Sendwithus is typically for external communication as we pretty much use slack for everything.

You should consider email as a formal way of communicating, especially with external customers and vendors.

## How do you prove it?

Your emails are professional and well structured.  

You respond in timely fashion - a good pattern is to review your inbox twice a day and ensure everything has been responded to.

You spell check your emails before you send them.

If you correspond outside of Sendwithus your emails have a signature.

You anticipate questions and answer them in the original email reducing back and forth.

When you add people to an email thread you add a note at the top about it.  "+Brad..."

When you remove people from a thread, you add a note about it at the top and move them to BCC.  "Brad to BCC"

You don't use BCC for anything else. (BCC is super dangerous) 

You don't use your email as a task list - you should use asana / your calendar for tasks and scheduling.

You maintain inbox zero. 

You set your out of office replies when you're on holiday, delegating responses and contact information.

Gmail navigation pro-tips (from jem?): 

* When viewing a list, `j` and `k` will go up and down the list (vim style).

    * From there, you can use `x` to toggle select messages

    * `e` will archive the selected message(s)

    * `enter` will take you in to the currently highlighted message

* when viewing an email, the `[` and `]` hotkeys will *archive the current message and navigate* to the next (or previous) message in your inbox. 

    * If you want to navigate without automatically archiving, `j` / `k`

    * `e` shortcut will archive the current message then send you back to the list view
