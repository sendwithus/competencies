# Competency - Research

A thorough investigation into the domain that reveals existing available knowledge or highlights the gap in existing available knowledge.  For environments with high information turnover, this is primarily to do with your ability to leverage resources available on or through the Internet. For slower moving targets such as geology or human understanding the library is still useful.  (though it's probably faster to buy the book through amazon)

## How do you prove it?

Given a problem with which you have very little domain knowledge, you understand the problem lies outside of your current understanding and that the subsequential challenge is learning the problem domain sufficiently to begin asking the right kind of questions.  You may understand what the problem is, but the wealth of knowledge available to you is locked behind the language of the domain.

During your research into a alien problem domain you have a sense for how deep the mismatch between your current and desired understanding is.  The feeling of "this is just the tip of the iceberg" and I need to devote considerable time to this unknown thing.

Given a problem that you have domain knowledge of, you can find a wide breadth of sources talking about this domain or prove the inaccessibility of this knowledge.

You organize and record this information for later use in an organized and efficient way.

Given a problem domain that exists within the purview of your role, you have a predefined list of the places you will start looking for answers.

## How do you improve it?

Fear is the primary motivator for not learning.   Learning is making mistakes.  Learning is having the humility to admit lack of knowledge in front of other people. Feeling safe within your team is critical to this activity.

Frank Herbert, Dune: "I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."

Do research into an unfamiliar topic.  Pick something you have no ideas about and spend 15 minutes looking into it.  Go as deep and as wide as you can. 

Do research into a familiar topic.  See if you can find something brand new about that area.
