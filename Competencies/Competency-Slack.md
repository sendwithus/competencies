# Competency - Slack

Slack is an instant messaging platform built for business.  We use it internally to do lots and lots of our communication - so much so, that we hardly ever use email for internal communication.  

There are lots of channels and lots of noise in slack, so it is a good idea to become proficient in this tool. 

Sendwithus values transparency, so as a rule, channels are mostly public and open to everyone and where it makes sense, we try to have conversations in public channels rather than DM'ing.

If there isn't a good channel to have this conversation, consider adding a new channel!

## How do you prove it?

You know how to use search and advanced search.

You edit messages appropriately.

You know how to use snippets and posts.

You know how to pin items and what they're useful for.

You have joined all the channels you are interested in.

Channels you create have a purpose set as part of the creation.
