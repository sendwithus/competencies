# Competency - Leading

Leading vs managing: an entire book could be (has been?) written on the nuances differentiating the two.

Leaders help coordinate the people they work with, providing direction. They are concerned with the macroscopic when the rest of the group is addressing the micro.

Leading is about setting a good example, always doing your best to model proactive and productive interactions.

When things go wrong, it's about taking responsibility. When things go right, it's about sharing the reward and acknowledgement.

Being a competent leader means seeking buy in or consensus. Decisions need to be weighted based on the stakeholders, and leaders may attempt to persuade (or at least educate) those with dissenting opinions.

Leaders lift up those around them, providing resources and direction to overcome obstacles when possible. If nothing else, they offer an empathetic ear when not.

Leaders need to be strong communicators.
