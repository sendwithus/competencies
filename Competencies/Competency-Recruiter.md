# Competency - Recruiter

One place to find awesome people is through awesome people.  If you work at Sendwithus, chances are, you're awesome.  And so we would probably be interested in the awesome people you know.

## How do you prove it?

You have the recruiter t-shirt.

You can pitch the culture and company.

## How do you improve it?

Understand that recruiting someone is often a multi-year process and thus we're interested in referrals from people that currently aren't looking for a new company to work for as well as people who are.

When you meet new people and they seem awesome, ask them if they know anyone awesome and chat with them on linkedin.
