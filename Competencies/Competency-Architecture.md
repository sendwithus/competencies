# Competency - Architecture

Being able to architect things so that they stay up and remain functional long into the future.

## How do you prove it?

On a whiteboard describe an architecture so that various different levels of experience can understand it, the benefits, the downsides, where it fits best, where it shouldn't be used.

Have an architect give you a problem and see if you can solve it or how you would go about solving it.

Give examples of good architectural blocks and how they're used together.

Talk about systemic problems and how they can be used to pinpoint bad architecture.

Show that you know how to move from one architecture to another. 

Have a conversation about a problem. An architect should want to communicate, asking questions to explore the problem with you. They should not rely on you to have your problem fully thought out. They should be able to help guide you by recognizing tacit knowledge and eliciting important details. A bad sign is jumping to a solution too quickly. A good sign is an effort to achieve mutual understanding of the problem before solving it.

You have built 3 architecturally important systems and they have proven value and resilience.

A lot of good architecture is horribly screwing up architecture in your past and now being wise and this takes time. 

Go forth and build things for years.  Read about other peoples failures.

Take responsibility for EVERYTHING.  Ask yourself "If this was my company, and I was the CEO what would I want my architect to do here?"  

That gripping sense of doom, that's your inner architect saying, maybe do more research here?

Follow podcasts and engineering blogs, especially ones focused on system retrospectives, best practices and experience reports

Take a requirements engineering course (coursera for example)

Take a UML/diagram modeling course (may be redundant to requirements eng) (coursera etc?)
