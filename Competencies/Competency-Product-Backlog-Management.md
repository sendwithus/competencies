# Competency - Product Backlog Management

The backlog is the system where all near term / future parts of the product are recorded and prioritized.  We manage ours in asasa.

## How do you prove it?

Your working backlog has less than 100 items in it.  These are high level features/ideas that may break out into many user stories.

You have a system that separates out raw ideas and away from the backlog while still making sure everyone who had an idea feels heard.

The tickets capture who will use the feature and how they will be used.

Every ticket in the backlog has a high level estimate of value.

Every ticket in the backlog has a high level estimate of effort.

Each item in the top 25% is so well described (some people attach videos) that any ticket can be picked up by development and with no interaction with the product manager they can accurately assess the scope of work and every stakeholder that it benefits.

Every item in the top 25% has a set of acceptance criteria that lists off of the ways the product owner will enforce quality and completeness after development work is complete.

You hold client product roadmap meetings once a quarter that talk about the direction of the product.

You hold client roundtables once a quarter that gather feedback and generate new product ideas.  You use these sessions to get a feeling for relative importance of stories for clients.
