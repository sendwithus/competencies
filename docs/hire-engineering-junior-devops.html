<strong>Engineering - Junior DevOps</strong><br><br>

<p>Welcome to Searchspring, we&rsquo;re happy you&rsquo;re applying!  We think the most important thing about Searchspring, about working
anywhere, in fact, is the people and how they interact.</p><br>

<p>At Searchspring we foster an environment of caring, helpful, considerate and empathic people.  We think that&rsquo;s the best
environment to foster excellence and its one of the things we care most about in our hiring process.  If you are empathic and able to talk with humility and encourage others to thrive, we want to hear from you!</p><br>

<p>We don&rsquo;t want brilliance without empathy. We don&rsquo;t want creators who don&rsquo;t share. We don&rsquo;t want rock stars that
don&rsquo;t contribute to the community.</p><br>

<strong>What it&rsquo;s like to be a DevOps Engineer</strong><br>

<p>DevOps is the marriage of development and systems operations. Modern systems administration has been largely codified in software these days and requires in equal parts an understanding of systems architecture and software development. You must learn to understand how to administer systems and write software to do so. You must learn to pick up new languages quickly. You must also be able to rapidly learn new technologies as you are constantly being required to implement and administer new systems.</p><br>

<p>The job also requires a lot of on call availability. You are the first line of defense, keeping systems available and dealing with unforeseen issues. This job will impact your social life, and requires effort to learn to maintain a work/life balance. This challenge is fulfilling but not enjoyed by everyone.  If you are the type of person who needs to go incommunicado while not at work, this role is not for you.</p><br>

<p>The following technologies are currently being used here, you don&rsquo;t need to know them all, but you should definitely know what they are.</p><br>

<p><strong>Coding:</strong> Mostly Typescript/Javascript/Node.js, Golang with some maintenance of Java, Python, Clojure, Scala, PHP</p><br>

<p><strong>Back End:</strong> ElasticSearch, MySQL, Redis, Redshift, RDS, Lambda</p><br>

<p><strong>Front End:</strong> React, Cypress.io, Mithril.js, Redux, Ospec, Karma, Jasmine,</p><br>

<p><strong>DevOps:</strong> AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins, Cloud Build, Prometheus, Grafana, Loki</p><br>

<p>Development teams are aligned behind a specific part of the product and we develop
software using Basecamp&rsquo;s Shape Up methodology.  <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">https://basecamp.com/shapeup</a></p><br>

<p>Our offices are split between five geographic areas in many different time zones so you will need to become
adept at distributed working and familiar with the tools that facilitate this.  (Miro, Slack, Google Meet, etc&hellip;)</p><br>

<strong>Why you might like it</strong><br>

<p>If you love puzzle solving, you&rsquo;ll find lots of it in this role. In this career path you’ll be a perpetual student at every level. There are always new skills to acquire, and real cases to employ them. This job gives you the opportunity to work with bleeding edge technologies in a real world environment. You will have a clear and tangible impact participating in the design and building of elegant solutions to create a beautiful system.</p><br>

<strong>Why we might like you</strong><br>

<p>You have a strong drive to collaborate with others. You possess the ability to express your ideas and defend them. You demonstrate humility, empathy and professionalism; the ability to admit when you’re wrong, understanding when others make mistakes, and the comportment to deal with others in a respectful way in both situations.</p><br>

<strong>What you need</strong><br>

<p>At Searchspring we use a competency based management system to hire and train people.<br />
For this role there are skills that you are expected to have and skills that you will be expected to learn.
Each of the skills  below link to a GitHub page describing that skill, and how you learn it, and how we
expect you to prove that you have it.  Some of these maybe not be 100% filled in - please feel free to create a
pull request and submit how you think this skill should be defined.</p><br>
